Let us stTo make clear what this site is about, I will start from a very simple example
The application we want to create is 
Another ... of mine is food. I like to eat and I like to cook. So
A question often heard is "What do we eat today?".

It is this category of applications that this website is about. Applications build around a particular part of the . A set of related concepts, the domain model. The application manipulates instances of those concepts.
Those applications are about data in a certain domain. They allow users to manipulate those data. Our application is about ingredients, quantities and . Those elements, lets call them concepts
The concepts are related to each other. A recipe combines 
The applications consist of pages to display particular instances of those concepts. One can imagine a form 
Take the example of a

Applications have screens that display particular sets of data to the user and let him change some of these data. 

There can be different versions of an application. A version for smartphone and another for the laptop. 
They are not the same, but serve the same purpose.

But again, they only differ . If you make abstaction of the details they are the same. What the UAM aims at is to provide a description that is the same for the different platforms.
