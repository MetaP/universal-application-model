# Universal Application Model

concepts and features
There are a lot of application frameworks for different environments. (See Application Framework [TechOpedia]) Most of these frameworks share a lot of concepts. The ***<span class="concept-intro">Universal Application Model</span>*** intends to incorporate all useful concepts of any , or at least the most usef, and organize them in a single conprehensive domain model.
### Where does this idea come from?
For more than 4 decades now, I am developing software. And strangely enough I have the impression that I've been doing the same thing for most of the time. Most of my work had to do with applications that ... . The last 2 decades I worked for a company that creates software for banks. 

Technology has changed a lot during my career. I started in a time that client/server was something new. The PC was... There were no handhelds or tablets. Internet didn't exist. Remote communciations were over a beeping modem and the active memory of my PC was 512 kB. (Yes, kilo not mega or tera bytes)

But the programs already resembled . I created forms to . I started with . I've used Oracle, 
In those days . I started with dBase III on my father's PCfrom Ashton-Tate, Microsoft Access

Oh, isn't it magic, abstaction. Remove See a primitive thing as a

## Vision

There are a lot of application frameworks. However, when we make abstraction of implementation details, we find that most of them share common features and concepts. The model that comprises and structures these shared concepts, is what I coin as the ***<span class="concept-intro">Universal Application Model</span>***. This model serves as the domain model for data-driven application development. It provides a formal representation of the concepts that developers use to create such applications. This application model should not be confused with the domain model of specific application being developed, although it does build upon it.

One could say that we are talking here about domain-driven development with a dual domain: the data domain targeted by the application and the application domain. If we take the example of a bank, the former would include concepts like bank account and customer and the latter form, pages and menus.
